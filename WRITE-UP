What I learned from making a small text-to-speech website/app

	SpeechSynthesis API
	DOM elements
	using techniques such as 'const' keyword and 'addEventListener' method calls
	using Javascript to create multiple HTML elements 
	utilizing input from HTML input elements into Javascript output
	using local storage and session storage to (temporarily) save information
	using the 'script' tag into a project
	displaying output in HTML

Things I still have trouble with

	CSS styling (e.g. centering, positioning HTML elements)
	displaying alerts for use with testing
	
Am I done with the project?
	Yes
		have no feeling toward project now - it filled its purpose in helping me learn more about the SpeechSynthesis API and using user input for an app
		
What next?
	Something which can teach me more about CSS
		need to learn how to polish the visuals of an app while also making the project
			would have to be 'simple' - 2-3 days of work
			would allow me to make a simple type up of project during project
